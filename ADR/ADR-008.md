# ADR-008 — Reorganize analyzer into analysis.go + analyzer.go

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The analyzer currently mixes:
- result structure definition,
- PDF parsing logic,
- helper functions.

This reduces clarity and makes the analyzer file grow quickly.

## Decision
Split the package into:

- `analysis.go` → struct definitions and data models
- `analyzer.go` → main PDF parsing logic
- `wordcount.go` → helper logic for counting words

This keeps each file focused on a single concern.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Promotes readability and organization.
- Prepares the package for future growth.
- Easier for new contributors to understand.

### Negative
- More files to navigate.
- Requires updating imports across the project.

## Alternatives
1. Keep everything in analyzer.go  
Rejected: structure will degrade quickly.

2. Jump directly to multi-layer architecture  
Rejected: premature for Phase 2.
