# ADR-021 — Introduce OpenAPI Documentation (Swagger UI)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The API has matured with architecture, validation, observability, and tests.
However, it lacks auto-generated API documentation.

Developers require:
- clear request/response examples,
- schema definitions,
- automatic UI exploration,
- consistent API contracts,
- ability to test endpoints manually.

Swagger/OpenAPI is the industry standard for REST services in Go ecosystems.

## Decision
Integrate Swagger documentation **only at the HTTP adapter layer**, keeping the
domain, application, and ports unmodified, preserving Clean Architecture.

Chosen libraries:
- `swaggo/swag` (OpenAPI generator)
- `swaggo/gin-swagger` (Swagger UI handler)
- `swaggo/files` (embedded UI)

Documentation comments will live only:
- above each HTTP handler
- under `/cmd/api/docs/` auto-generated by `swag init`

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automatic API documentation
- Fully interactive Swagger UI
- No domain or use case contamination
- Ideal for onboarding and QA

### Negative
- Requires `go install swag` locally
- Requires consistently maintaining doc comments

## Alternatives
A) Handwritten OpenAPI YAML  
Rejected — more work, less accuracy.

B) No documentation  
Rejected — unacceptable for production-ready API.
