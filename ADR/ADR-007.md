# 📄 `ADR/ADR007.md` — Extract word counting logic into wordcount.go

# ADR-007 — Extract word counting logic into wordcount.go

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Phase 1 placed word-count logic inside the analyzer file.  
As PDF analysis grows, this file becomes too large and mixes responsibilities.

## Decision
Move word-count logic into its own file:

The function remains simple and naive, but separating it improves readability and prepares for unit tests.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Smaller, more focused files.
- Easier to test in isolation.
- Sets a pattern for additional helpers (e.g., page count, metadata).

### Negative
- Slight increase in file count.
- Navigation requires checking multiple files.

## Alternatives
1. Leave the function in analyzer.go  
Rejected: analyzer file becomes bloated later.

2. Introduce a WordCounter interface  
Rejected: unnecessary complexity for Phase 2.
