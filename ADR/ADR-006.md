# ADR-006 — Introduce AnalysisResult struct

## Status
Accepted

## Context
In Phase 2, the PDF analyzer returns multiple values (extracted text and word count).  
As the project evolves, more analysis fields will be added (e.g., page count, keywords, hash, file size).  
Returning multiple values becomes harder to extend and reduces clarity.

## Decision
Introduce an `AnalysisResult` struct to encapsulate all analysis output fields:

```go
type AnalysisResult struct {
    Content   string
    WordCount int
}
```

This structure will evolve over time as more metadata is extracted.

## Consequences
### Positive

Central place for analysis results.

Easy to extend with new fields.

Cleaner method signatures.

Easier to document and test.

### Negative

Minor refactor required in handler and analyzer.

Slight increase in indirection (struct instead of raw returns).

## Alternatives

Continue returning multiple values
Rejected: does not scale.

Introduce a full domain model with interfaces now
Rejected: premature for Phase 2.
